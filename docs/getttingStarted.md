# Getting Started

## Sensor -> Log Server
run `./bin/logServer.sh && ./bin/sensor_run.sh` from the root dir to see progress there. It just creates some log files in src/logs That needs to be converted to a database.

## Backend webApp -> Frontend webApp
run `./bin/backEnd_run.sh && ./bin/frontEnd_run.sh` from the root dir to see the connection between the express API and bare bones react front end.
